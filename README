EQUATION SOLVER
This program provides a simple interactive menu-driven interface for solving various types of
mathematical equations. It's well-structured and allows the user to choose the type of equation 
they want to solve. The equation-solving functions handle different cases and provide solutions
based on user input.
The code begins by including necessary header files, such as <stdio.h> for input and output 
functions and <math.h> for mathematical functions.
Function declarations for five different equation-solving functions are provided. 
The functions are named according to the type of equation they solve.
The main function is the entry point of the program.
It presents the user with a main menu where they can choose to solve equations or exit the
program.
Inside a do-while loop, it checks the user's input and navigates to the appropriate section 
based on the choice.
If the user chooses to solve equations (mCond == 1), a sub-menu for equation types is displayed. 
The user then selects a specific equation type (eqCond), and the corresponding equation-solving
function is called.
If the user chooses to exit the program (mCond == 2), the program exits.
The loop continues until the user chooses to exit (mCond == 3).
Equation-Solving Functions
The following functions solve specific types of equations:
1. Linear Equation Solver: 
Solves a linear equation (ax+b=0).
Takes input for coefficients 'a' and 'b'.
Checks for special cases (infinite solutions, no solution, or regular solution).
2. Quadratic Equation Solver:
Solves a quadratic equation (ax2+bx+c=0).
Takes input for coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
Calculates the discriminant to determine the nature of the roots (real, double, or complex).
3. Cubic Equation Solver:
Solves a cubic equation (ax3+bx2+cx+d=0) using Cardano's formula.
Takes input for coefficients 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
Handles different cases based on the discriminant.
4. Exponential Equation Solver:
Solves an exponential equation (a⋅e b⋅x=c).
Takes input for coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
Calculates the solution using logarithms.
5. Linear System Solver:
Solves a system of two linear equations (a1x+b1y=c1 and a2x+b2y=c2) using using Cramer's rule.
Takes input for coefficients of both equations.
Checks for the determinant to determine if the system has a unique solution.
